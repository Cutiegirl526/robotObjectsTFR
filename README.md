## Requirements

1. Create an object prototype called **Student** using an object constructor function 
  * Set the parameters as _id_, _first_, _grade_, _age_, and _favProject_.

2. Create the key values of the object prototype using **this** and set their values to the parameter values
    + `this.firstName = first;`

3. Create an object prototype for each team member and pass individual team members information as the parameters.
    + `var teamMember1 = new Student(idNumber, "firstName1", grade, age, "Favorite Jr.DevLeague Project");`

## Your Goal
1. Create a function called **printStudentInfo**
2. Set the parameter to _student_ 
3. `Return` the students information from the object prototype in a single string.

Call this function multiple times to print out every students information.
